<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

## Star Wars Universe 1.0
Welcome ðŸ‘‹ This repo is a showcase of an android application which uses Clean Architecture and manages states using a FSM(Finite state machine)
This repo implements a small but scalable (!) app which interacts with the open Star Wars API at
https://swapi.dev/

The app contains 2 main areas:
* Character Search (Home Screen)
* Character Details (Details Screen)

The following attributes are displayed for the character details:
* name
* birth_year
* height (in cm and feet/inches)
* name
* language
* homeworld
* population (planets)
* films (movies the character appeared in)
* opening_crawl (detailed description of each movie)

### Built With

* [Clean Arch](https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html)
* [RxJava2](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava)
* [MVVM](https://bit.ly/2GmZICu)

## Dependencies

All the dependencies (external libraries) are defined in the single place - Gradle [dependencies.gradle](dependencies.gradle) folder. This approach allows to easily manage dependencies and use the same dependency version across all modules. 

## Some notable mentions for Code review

This sections mentions some of the issues not covered in this code submission:

- Have not covered any UI tests in this project.

- UI layer is barebones but can be improved upon on further enchancements.

- The Error representation on UI is not covered , but is handled in other layers as states.
